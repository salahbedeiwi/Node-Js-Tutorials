<!--
    Step #0
        npm init

    Step #1
        Create express server to run your backend
        npm install express
        "dependencies": {
            "express": "^4.18.2"
        }
    
    Step #3
        Create file name call node.js
        const express = require("express");
        var app = express();

    Step #5
        Create URL using HTTP Request Methods (Get, Post, Put/Patch, Delete, Options)

    Step #6
        Run my server or keep my server listen to users requests
        like when they visit website/url or any url, it will keep running
        => app.listen(port to run my site 3000 or any number, callback function () => {});
            once createed: my web server is now listening to all user requests

    Step #7
        To see your app working, click on powershell and enter
            node index.js 
                    => this will only run one time, but any update or changes 
                        to my site, you must ctl+c and re run step#7
            Step #8
                Close the listen before installing this:
                    npx nodemon index.js
                    => Better use this to keep your app listen to all updates/changes
                        and runs automatically. index.js very much keep this file running

    Step #8
        Explaination
        request type is get, path to my request is /contact & port
        app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {});

    step #9
        Install EJS Package
            -> this will ease pass parameters to html files to 
                be rendered later.
                to call file in node js
                    -> req.sendFile(__dirname+ "/views/number.ejs")
                note extension name for any html file changed to ejs not html

        Also download EJS Lanaguage Support by Visual Studio Code
        once loaded you can write your conditions and display data
        in your ejs file
        res.render("number.ejs", {
            name: 'Salah Bedeiwi',
            age: 35,
            numbers: numbers
        });
        <%= name %>
        <% if(name.length < 10 ){ %>
            <p>Hello <%= name %></p>
        <% } %>
        <% } else { %>
            <p>Your name is short :: => <%= name %></p>
        <% } %>


    Step #10
            Using MOngoDB Database
            Best to user with node js is MongoDB
            Go to mongodb.com and create an account first
            and we will also use "Atlas" service with mongo DB
            This will help us use db easier and connect to db

            Create DB and also create user name and password
            pass: pMTO7kyrO67xSaox
            username: bedei001

    Step #11
            Install mongoose on this project
            to create and deal with mongodb
            create tables, collections
            npm install mongoose
    Step #12
            To connect to db
            first must get the url from your db
            click on connect and choose first option "Drivers"
            mongodb+srv://bedei001:<password>@cluster0.o4uxcay.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    Step #13
        If you ever have an error like app crashes
                when calling mongoose to connect to mongoDB
                or while require("mongoose")
                Make sure mongoose works with node v.16+
                so reinstall node to latest version
    Step #14
        Create models folder
        This will have all entities for my work

        MVC (models, views, index.js)
        MODELS: this will have all models - DB
        VIEWS: MY HTML VERY MUCH
        CONTROLLERS: index.js

    Step #15
        1. Deploy NOdE JS Project to could
        
        2. open github desktop to add your project on it.
        3. sign in github
        4. click to add -> add existing repository
        5. choose existing folder location
        6. You will find you haven't created a repo.. so create one
        7. while creating it.. keep NAME as it is... so no problems occur
        8. click on GIT IGNORE and choose node
        9. click on create repository
        10. click on public repository
        11. You can change the name of the repository you like
        12. You can choose whether or not your web app to be public/private
        13. Then click publish repo.
        14. ------------- Go to render.com --------------
            a. The fastest way to host your code at render.com
                render.com has free TLS Certificates, Global CDN ...

            1. click on new -> web service -> build and deploy from GIT Repo.       
            2. next... 
            3. select repo that you like to add which is this project
            4. then click connect..
            5. Fill in data as it shows
                -Note name you choose will be in your real url like
                node-js-tutorials -> so type something worth it
                https://node-js-tutorials.onrender.com/
            6. Start Command: node index.js
            6b. Build Command and type npm install
            7. Root directory.. keep it empty
            8. if you are not using yarn command on your project
                -> go to Build Command and type npm install
            9. if you ever face connecting DB Error..
                Make sure both on the same server
                -> go to mongodb and select region to Oregno US
                -> go to render.com and select same region
            10. Go to render and click on logs to view command promots
                issue or logs to your website...
            11. Your project is working from cloud..
                Exactly same thing as local but now is from could
                ------------ or -----------
                Go click on connect on the top right corner on render.com
                    You will see list of IP Addresses to added to your project
                    Copy those and those to security -> network access tab 
                    on mongodb of your project and add all ip copied earlier

            12. You will see the link on render.com for your app 
                that you just uploaded
            13. https://node-js-tutorials.onrender.com
            13. https://node-js-tutorials.onrender.com/showArticles

            Now test your code and work

            also go to post man and add more articles
            whether local or using this host name:
            https://node-js-tutorials.onrender.com/showArticles
            http://localhost:3008/showArticles
            and use post to add new articles

            also http://localhost:3008/showArticles will be used FOR UI
            to send/retrieve data from it
